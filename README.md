# Project

This project implements an ordinary (not in place) quicksort on a number of different pathalogical cases.
It then analyses the execution times of running these algorithms to examine the performance of the quicksort on 
these cases.

## Project Structure

The project is split up into three packages. The sorter and cases packages contain are written in Java while 
the analysis is written in Python.

#### Sorter

Implements an ordinary quicksort using the final element as the pivot.
