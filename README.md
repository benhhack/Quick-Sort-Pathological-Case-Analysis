# Project

This project implements an ordinary (not in place) quicksort on a number of different pathalogical cases.
It then analyses the execution times of running these algorithms to examine the performance of the quicksort on 
these cases.

## Using the Project

To use this project, run the sort runner from the Sort Runner class.
Then, run the analysis (analysis.ipynb) in a Jupyter Notebook.

The tests can be run within sorter package and the cases.tests package.
Note that the Pathological Cases methods which 
create arrays were not tested since these are trivial.
